# Get Started

## Transcribers

[Whisper](transcribers#whisper-recommended) is the default transcriber and is used to convert recorded speech to text. All transcribers are 100% offline and on-device.

## Transformers

Transformers are used to modify text produced by transcribers before they are saved or exported. By default, [to-lowercase](/transformers/to-lowercase) and [remove-punctuation](/transformers/remove-punctuation) are in use.

## Exporters

Exporters are used to submit, edit and delete text in files, notes applications etc. There are no exporters in use by default, which allows you to use Vocode as a standalone notes app.

**Vocode is designed to be used as a quick capture to export to your notes, where you can then manage or mark as done.** This means that:

- When editing notes in Vocode, the exporter will be edited.
- When dismissing notes in Vocode, the exporter will not be edited.
- When deleting notes in Vocode, the exporter will be edited (the note will be deleted).
