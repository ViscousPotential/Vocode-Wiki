# Push-to-talk

**This no longer works well on Android 13+ (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/wpt39b/dev_warning_if_you_update_to_android_13_the/) for an explanation)**

Using [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_GB), it is possible to use Vocode as a push-to-talk quick capture method.

<Hint type="info" variant="outer">
  Better integrations with Tasker are coming..
</Hint>

These steps are specific to setting up push-to-talk with the power button (Android 12 Samsung Device) but can be adjusted to work with any device and button with some work

1. Add a New Profile with `Event` ⮕ `Logcat Entry`
2. Use a component and filter so that it triggers when you want recording to start
    * Component: `PhoneWindowManagerExt`
    * Filter: `consume powerLongPress`
3. Create a `Send Intent` task that looks like this to communicate with Vocode
    * Action: `START_RECORDING`
    * Package: `com.viscouspot.vocode`
    * Class: `com.viscouspot.vocode.VocodeService`
    * Target: `Service`
