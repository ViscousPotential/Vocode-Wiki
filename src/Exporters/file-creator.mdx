# File Creator

A basic file creator exporter compatible with Obsidian and plaintext notes files. 

<Hint type="info" variant="outer">
  It is recommended to use a directory that won't often be edited outside Vocode to reduce failures when trying to edit or delete notes within Vocode.
</Hint>

## Config

| Name       |   Type    | Default | Description                                |
| :--------- | :-------: | :-----: | :----------------------------------------- |
| File Directory | `Path` | `/storage/emulated/0/example` | The directory to edit/export to |
| Decoration | `string` | `%s` | This allows you to format text before exporting. `%s` represents the output from the exporter |
| Template File | `Path` | `<none>` | Specify a template file to populate any new notes |
| File Type | `string` | `.md` | The file extension for any created notes |

## Exporting

Note files will be created in the directory, with either no contents or the contents of the template file.

## Editing

Notes will be edited using a rename of the note file stored in Vocode

## Deleting

Notes will be deleted by deleting the note file (**this is not reversible**)
