# File Editor

A basic file editor exporter compatible with Obsidian and plaintext notes files. 

<Hint type="info" variant="outer">
  It is recommended to use a file that won't often be edited outside Vocode to reduce failures when trying to edit or delete notes within Vocode.
</Hint>

## Config

| Name       |   Type    | Default | Description                                |
| :--------- | :-------: | :-----: | :----------------------------------------- |
| File Path | `Path` | `/storage/emulated/0/example.md` | The file to edit/export to |
| Decoration | `string` | `%s` | This allows you to format text before exporting. `%s` represents the output from the exporter |

## Exporting

Notes will be added with a newline after them, on the last line of the file. This assumes a newline at the end of the file at all times.

## Editing

Notes will be edited using a find and replace in the file of the text stored in Vocode with the user entry

## Deleting

Notes will be deleted using a similar find and replace to remove the stored text
